# Projet_HPC
Re-analysis of ATAC-seq data from the Gomez-Cabrero et al. (2019) publication on a UCA Mesocenter computing cluster.

One of the objectives of this study is to build a workflow to identify regions of the genome accessible to transcription as the DNA opens and detaches from the nucleosomal complex (Identification of unique and common accessibility sites between cell stages). 

Experimental design is as follows: 
- Cells collected for 0 and 24 hours (after treatment with tamoxifen)
- 3 biological replicates of about 50 000 cells
